in node.js we need to define http server to handle requests and responses. 
for that we use 2 things requests(req) and responses(res).
requests are made by clients to the server and responses are sent back by the server to the clients.

we use createServer method from http module to create a server.
const http = require('http'); // importing http module

to apply route we use req.url to check the url of the request and res.end() to send response back to client. (in http module)

req.url == '/' -> res.end('Home Page')  // this is how we define a route for home page
req.url == '/about' -> res.end('About Page') // this is how we define a route for about page etc

server.listen(3000) // server listens on port 3000, we can access it on localhost:3000
there are lot of port numbers available to use, we can use any port number above 1024.




EXPRESS.JS >>>>


it is a web application framework for node.js, it simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs.
to use express we need to install it first using npm.
npm install express
after installing we can import it in our file.
const express = require('express'); // importing express module
const app = express(); // creating an instance of express

then we can use app.method_name to define routes.
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Home Page'); // sending response back to client
}); etc.

app.listen(3000); // server listens on port 3000


app.set('view engine', 'ejs'); // setting ejs as the view engine for rendering dynamic content in html pages




MIDDLEWARE IN EXPRESS.JS >>>>


Three types of middlewares in Express.js:

1. Built-in Middleware: These are the middleware functions that come with Express.js.
2. Third-party Middleware: These are middleware functions created by the community and can be installed via npm.
3. Custom Middleware: These are middleware functions that you create yourself to handle specific tasks in your application.

// Example of Custom Middleware

app.use((req, res, next) => {  // in this function next is a callback to pass control to the next middleware function
    console.log('This is a custom middleware function');
    next(); // pass control to the next route handler, without this the request will be left hanging!
});

//Example of Third-party Middleware (morgan):

const morgan = require('morgan'); // importing morgan middleware
app.use(morgan('dev')); // using morgan middleware for logging HTTP requests in 'dev'
// 'dev' is a predefined format string for concise output colored by response status for development use.

morgan will log the details of each request made to the server, such as method, URL, status code, response time etc.

we can also define middleware for specific routes only.

#PROCESS ---

app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {  // here we define a middleware only for '/',  
    const a = 5
    const b = 20
    console.log(a+b); // so this will log only when we go through '/'

    next()
},  (req,res)=>{
    res.render('index')     // rendering the ejs file
})

// In this example, when a request is made to '/', the first middleware logs the sum of a and b, then calls next() to pass control to the next function which renders the 'index' ejs file.


// Exaple of Built-in Middleware:

app.use(express.json())                         // built-in middleware to parse JSON data in request body
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}))   // built-in middleware to parse URL-encoded


// FORM CONTROLLS >>>


so that we can extract data from frontend, and send it to backend or server for processing.
we can use query parameters to get data from frontend forms.
app.get('/get-form-data', (req,res)=>{
    console.log(req.query) // req.query will contain the form data as an object
    res.send('data received') // sending response back to client
})

here if we have a form in frontend with method GET and action '/get-form-data', when the form is submitted the data will be available in req.query object in backend.
to show the data in console we use console.log(req.query), and in html form we can have input fields with name attributes to identify the data.

#FOR EXAMPLE:

<form method="GET" action="/get-form-data">
    <input type="text" name="username" />
    <input type="password" name="password" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
when this form is submitted, the data will be available in req.query as:
{
    username: 'value entered in username field',
    password: 'value entered in password field'
}

// we can also use POST method to send form data to backend.
and it is more secure than GET method as the data is not visible in the URL.

req.body will contain the form data as an object, instead of req.query.(for POST method)

we also need to use method='POST' in form tag in frontend, so thart the data is sent using POST method.
